Data Bootcamp Module 3 challenge: Python

Shoutout to Python.org, GeeksforGeeks.org, and the Xpert Learning Assistant (Xpert LA)! These were great resources for explaining (or re-explaining) functions and variables, showing examples, and answering any other questions that came up outside of class.

PyBank breakdown of tasks:
1. Import the necessary modules - 'os' and 'csv'
2. Open the CSV file, 'budget_data.csv'
3. Create lists for headers and columns for easier manipulation of data
4. Calculate the total number of months and net Profit/Losses
5. Calculate the changes from one row to the next in Profit/Losses and store in list (Xpert LA helped here)
6. Average the changes from the previous step (GeeksforGeeks reminded me how to use 'round()' and how to print to multiple lines)
7. Calculate the greatest increase and decrease in profits (Xpert LA was super helpful with this task)
8. Write "Financial analysis" to text file

PyPoll breakdown of tasks:
1. Import modules and open CSV file, 'election_data.csv'
2. Create lists to store headers and columns
3. Assuming that there are unique values in 'Ballot ID', find the total number of votes cast with the length function on list, 'ballots'
4. Find the candidates for whom votes were cast and the number of votes they each received
5. Find the percentage of votes each candidate received and round to 3 decimal places
6. Find the winner (Xpert LA was very instrumental in helping to get this challenge done, especially for steps 4, 5, and 6 of PyPoll)
7. Write "Election Results" to text file
