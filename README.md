Data Bootcamp Module 3 challenge: Python

Shoutout to Python.org, GeeksforGeeks.org, and the Xpert Learning Assistant! These were great resources for re-explaining functions and variables, showing examples, and answering any other questions that came up outside of class.

PyBank process breakdown:
    1. Import the necessary modules - 'os' and 'csv'
    2. Open the CSV file, budget_data.csv
    3. Create lists for headers and columns for easier manipulation of data
    4. Calculate the total number of months and net Profit/Losses
    5. Calculate the changes from one row to the next in Profit/Losses and store in list (Xpert LA helped here)
    6. Average the changes from the previous step (GeeksforGeeks showed me how to use 'round()' and how to print to multiple lines)
    7. Calculate the greatest increase and decrease in profits (Xpert LA was super helpful with this section)
